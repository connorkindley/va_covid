These queries aim to recreate data presented on Virginia's Covid19 Dashboard using the Virginia Department of Health's public datasets. The first three queries recreate the bar graphs on (1) < https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/see-the-numbers/covid-19-in-virginia/covid-19-in-virginia-cases/ > and (2) < https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/see-the-numbers/covid-19-in-virginia/covid-19-in-virginia-locality/> using data from < https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/ > under the section called "To download COVID-19 datasets click here". Before December, the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) had bar graphs with daily cases, deaths, and hospitalizations displayed on the covid19 summary dashboard, link 1, along with a yellow line representing the 7-day average. Daily counts, along with the 7-day average, is now found under the second link for the covid19 dashboard for localities. My queries and visualizations are based on the original graphs which combined the two new graphs. I personally believe my visualizations provide better information than the two new visualizations used by the VDH.

The last set of queries focus on finding the amount of Virginians who are fully vaccinated at any one date as well as cummulative totals of dose types - something that is reported but not shown in the public datasets.

Daily Cases and Daily Deaths were visualized in Tableau at this link < https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/connor1260/viz/VirginiaCOVID19SummaryData/Dashboard1 >.
