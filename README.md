These queries aim to recreate data presented on Virginia's Covid19 Dashboard using the Virginia Department of Health's public datasets. The first three queries recreate the bar graphs on < https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/see-the-numbers/covid-19-in-virginia/covid-19-in-virginia-cases/ > using data from < https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/ > under the section called "To download COVID-19 datasets click here". The last set of queries focus on finding the amount of Virginians who are fully vaccinated at any one date as well as cummulative totals of dose types - something that is reported but not shown in the public datasets.

Daily Cases and Daily Deaths were visualized in Tableau at this link < https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/connor1260/viz/VirginiaCOVID19SummaryData/Dashboard1 >.
